With BillAble, you’re able to bill!

BillAble was developed in response to the lack of a low-cost, effective and user-friendly billing system for the legal industry. Existing billing apps are expensive, 
complicated and challenging to integrate into smaller firms’ pre-existing work process.

App features such as comprehensive timesheets, automated invoicing, and payment summaries shorten the billing journey, enabling firms to send bills and receive payment faster. 
Where such payments are crucial to their survival, BillAble empowers small firms to optimize billing and focus on delivering exceptional legal services.
